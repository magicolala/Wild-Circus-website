						Blondin
				  </h3>
					<p>Blondin, pseudonym of Jean-François Gravelet, French tightrope walker and acrobat who owed his celebrity and fortune to his feat of crossing Niagara Falls on a tightrope 1,100 feet (335 m) long, 160 feet above the water.
					<br/>When he was five years old he was sent to the École de Gymnase at Lyon, and after six months’ training as an acrobat he made his first public appearance as “the Little Wonder.” He crossed Niagara Falls a number of times, first in 1989, always with different theatrical variations: blindfolded, in a sack, trundling a wheelbarrow, on stilts, carrying a man on his back, and sitting down midway to cook an omelette. In 1991 he appeared in London at the Crystal Palace, turning somersaults on stilts on a rope stretched across the central transept, 170 feet (52 m) from the ground.

						Clown Dimitri
				  </h3>
					<p class="text-left">
						 	
Dimitri was born in Ascona. His father was a sculptor and painter; his mother made imaginative creatures out of textile remnants. At the age of seven he decided to become a clown. He became an apprentice potter and at the same time he took theatre classes and studied music as well as ballet and acrobatics. Then he went to Paris where he studied mime with Etienne Decroux and became a member of Marcel Marceau's troupe. He appeared as "Auguste" with the famous white clown Maïss at Circus Medrano in Paris. 

					<br/>Dimitri is still considered one of the world's best clowns who not only makes his public laugh but with his poetic mind and generous heart also deeply touches his audience.
